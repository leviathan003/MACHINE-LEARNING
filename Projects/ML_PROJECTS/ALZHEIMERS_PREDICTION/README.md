A complete Machine Learning project with a flask website to detect the presence of alzheimer's disease in the patient from the provided data. </br>
Ask Dr. JUSRA FAPA (Just a Simple Random Forest Algorithm for Predicting Alzheimer's) to get to know your where you belong from :
- Having HIGH chance of Alzheimer's disease
- Having LOW chance of Alzheimers's disease
- Having HIGH chance of Converting to having Alzheimer's disease

The model has 85% accuracy to predict the labels and the dataset and notebook used are attached herewidth for testing the model with data whose results are known to us.

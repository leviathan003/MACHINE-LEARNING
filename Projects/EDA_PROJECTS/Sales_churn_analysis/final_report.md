    <b>Suggestions and Final Thoughts</b>
</p>

***
- The trend with females churning more maybe explained by the monthly charge ranges especially for senior females for whom pension amount might be a concern. Also it is noticed that senior females with no access to streaming tv or movies are churning more so providing offers for cheap access to streaming content to this demographic may lower churning. 
- Better tech support, device protection schemes, online security and online backup schemes are urgently advised. 
- Females with no family but with phone service probably churn more because they have higher costs of living alone.  
- Quality assessment of Fibre optics medium is urgently advised.
- People with month to month contract churn more because they have freedom to do so easily.
- People with paperless billing and e-check tend to churn more probably because extra charges of creating an e-check.
- Higher monthly rates cause higher churning as expected but total charges being low while churning being high indicate that people who are not availing all the services are more likely to churn, again offers and new packages may mitigate the situation.
- Churning being high in 1-12 months of tenure is probably because people are not getting a good first impression of the company and thus churning early, giving new users calculated bonus advantages may handle this.
